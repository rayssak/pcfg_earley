pcfg_earley
===========

An implementation of the Earley algorithm was developed in Java to propose a new approach for Context-Free Grammar (CFG) recognition and parsing of Portuguese (pt-BR) language given a specific corpus (although the focus was to generically cover Earley's properties). The main goal was to find the most appropriate data structure and data pre-processing manipulation in order to gain performance and Earley's coverage success rate.
